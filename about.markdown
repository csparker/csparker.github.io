<em>Overview</em>

I am a Research Associate in the Computational Imaging Group at the Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London. My research focus is on computational analysis of diffusion MRI data and its application for assessing brain pathology to neurodegenerative diseases.

<em>Background & Motivation</em>

During my Biomedical Research MRes at Imperial College I discovered the great potential for neuroimaging for understanding the brain and addressing clinical problems. 

The Medical Image Computing MSc provided training in state-of-the-art tools in biomedical image analysis. My [PhD Thesis][phd-thesis-link] in the area of Connectomics Neuroimaging is titled <em>"Human brain networks: consensus, reproducibility, inter-modal comparison and epilepsy pathology"</em>. You can read more about my background and skills in my <a href="ChrisParker_CV.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a>.

<em>Current Research</em>

I am primarily interested in identifying early brain cellular changes using diffusion MRI for the purpose of better understanding and treating neurological disease. In collaboration with my colleagues in CMIC, DRC, POND and the HRC, my research helps to address important questions such as: 
- What cellular changes are occuring prior to disease onset and in response to treatment? 
- How can biomarkers of early disease inform design of clinical trials?
- What types of cellular pathology are diffusion MRI biomarkers measuring? 

My academic publications which explore these questions are linked on my [Google Scholar profile][google-scholar].
